        <h1 align="center" style="color: white"> Welcome to Study Online !</h1>
        <p align="center" style="color: white">Online learning is a challenging but extremely rewarding way to achieve an array of qualifications - there are online options for everything from certificates to PhDs. Once surrounded by stigma, online education is now a respected way to achieve a recognized qualification. With courses available in almost every subject, and flexible timetables to suit almost every schedule, students are increasingly turning to online learning as a viable alternative to campus study. It could allow you to study abroad remotely, at a university not in your home country.</p>

        <p align="center" style="color: white">Advances in technology now allow students to study entirely online while still socializing with classmates, watching lectures and participating in subject-specific discussions.</p>

<p align="center" style="color: white">While some consider online learning to require a greater degree of self-motivation, institutions nowadays recognize that pastoral support is just as important as tutor feedback, and take great care to ensure that their students receive the same levels of support that they would receive on campus.</p>
